                <p class="font-lighter">Women are still vastly under-represented in the tech workforce, making it more difficult to find the right professional support and peers to connect and learn with.</p> 
                <p class="font-lighter">Not only is this a problem for young women themselves, but un-diverse teams will lead to bias in products and the tech future we will live in.</p>
